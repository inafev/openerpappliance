HOWTO UPDATE OPENERP
====================
OpenERP branches are update-able through Launchpad with the help of 
openerp-update script (a simple text console menu). Procedure:

1) Launch a terminal emulator like xterm or LXTerminal
2) Run the following command to get usage information:
	openerp-update --help
3) Run the OpenERP updater:
	openerp-update
   Or run the OpenERP updater without prompts:
	openerp-update fast
4) Full logging: /home/openerp/OpenERP-updates.txt file is created with
   records of installed or updated OpenERP revisions. This is useful to 
   be in control of your updates:
	less /home/openerp/OpenERP-updates.txt

HOWTO CHANGE YOUR KEYBOARD LAYOUT
=================================
Change your keyboard layout by clicking on "keyboard" icon or running the 
following command in a shell terminal:
  gnome-keyboard-properties  

LXDE Tip: 
  Add a keyboard indicator for LXPanel by right clicking on LXPanel (tool bar) ->
  add/remove Panel Items -> Panel Applets -> Add -> KEYBOARD LAYOUT SWITCHER

# RUNNING OPENERP APPLIANCE IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE
# WINDOWS HOSTS WITH VIRTUALBOX OR VMWARE PLAYER VIRTUAL MACHINES
##########################################################################

Both "VirtualBox Guest Additions" and "VMware Tools" provide better integration between 
the guest Operating System (this openerp appliance) and the host Operating System (Windows): 
    * Ability to move mouse between guest and host OS without having to press 
      the right CTRL key to switch
    * Clipboard support: cut/copy and paste between the guest and host OS
    * Screen resolution: automatic resize of the guest OS when you resize the VirtualBox 
      window 
    * shared folders between guest and host OS (highly recommended)
    * plug-and-play devices
    * clock synchronization 
      
SCREEN RESOLUTION ON VIRTUALBOX
HOWTO SETUP VIRTUALBOX GUEST ADDITIONS TO GET FULL SCREEN MODE 
==============================================================
1) Make sure your have installed “guest additions” ('Devices' tab), while
   your OpenERP Appliance is running. VirtualBox documentation describes 
   how to do this.
2) Run this script (located in /home/openerp/bin/): 

   virtualbox-guest-additions-installer.sh 

   Your OpenERP Appliance will be restarted
   Remember to run the former script each time your linux kernel is upgraded.
  
3) Stop your OpenERP Appliance running on VirtualBox 
4) INCREASE the amount of VIDEO RAM for the Virtual Machine to 128MB
   The default is 8 MB
5) Increase the amount of RAM for the Virtual Machine (1GB recommended)
6) Restart your OpenERP Appliance
7) If you reach a text based login screen when your appliance is restarted,
   press ALT+F7 to get the graphical desktop, and CTRL-ALT-F1 to get back to the console.

SCREEN RESOLUTION ON VMWARE PLAYER
HOWTO SETUP VMWARE TOOLS TO GET FULL SCREEN MODE 
================================================
1) "Virtual Machine" tab >> "Install VMware Tools"
2) Run this script (located in /home/openerp/bin/):

   vmware-tools-installer.sh  

   Your OpenERP Appliance will be restarted
   Remember to run the former script each time your linux kernel is upgraded.
   Increase the amount of RAM for the Virtual Machine (1GB recommended)

3) If you reach a text based login screen when your appliance is restarted,
   press ALT+F7 to get the graphical desktop, and CTRL-ALT-F1 to get back to the console.

NETWORK SETTINGS IN VIRTUALBOX / HOST-ONLY NETWORKING
HOWTO REACH OPENERP APPLIANCE ON A VIRTUALBOX MACHINE FROM WINDOWS HOST
=======================================================================
Set your VirtualBox machine to use the "Host-only Ethernet Adapter" in
configuration menu "Network" >> "Host Interface Settings" >> "Interface Name".

Like VMware, this is a virtual network adapter created during the installation.
It has its own subnet and behaves like a real interface, for all practical 
purposes. It's a router inside your computer, specifically managing guest 
machines. This is ideal for local development and testing. User programs like 
Firefox or ssh can operate through Host-only network adapter.

HOST-ONLY is recommended in VirtualBox when you don’t require to connect from 
an external machine in your LAN to your virtual machine. 

For host-only networking, like with internal networking, you may find the DHCP 
server useful that is built into VirtualBox. This can be enabled to then manage 
the IP addresses in the host-only network since otherwise you would need to 
configure all IP addresses statically:
      In the VirtualBox graphical user interface, you can configure all these 
      items in the global settings via "File" -> "Settings" -> "Network", which 
      lists all host-only networks which are presently in use. Click on the 
      network name and then on the "Edit" button to the right, and you can modify 
      the adapter and DHCP settings.
    
      Alternatively, you can use VBoxManage dhcpserver on the command line; please 
      see the section called “VBoxManage dhcpserver” at 
      http://www.virtualbox.org/manual for details

NETWORK SETTINGS IN VIRTUALBOX / BRIDGED NETWORKING
HOWTO REACH OPENERP APPLIANCE ON A VIRTUALBOX MACHINE FROM YOUR LAN
===================================================================
It leases IPs from outside your PC or laptop. For example, your guest machines
retrieve IP addresses from your wireless router, becoming another host(s) on
your wireless network.

To enable bridged networking, all you need to do is to open the Settings 
dialog of a virtual machine, go to the "Network" page and select "Bridged network" 
in the drop down list for the "Attached to" field. Finally, select desired host 
interface from the list at the bottom of the page, which contains the physical network 
interfaces of your systems. On a typical MacBook, for example, this will allow you to 
select between "en1: AirPort" (which is the wireless interface) and "en0: Ethernet", 
which represents the interface with a network cable.

NETWORK SETTINGS IN VMWWARE PLAYER / NAT NETWORKING
HOWTO REACH OPENERP APPLIANCE ON A VMWARE PLAYER MACHINE FROM WINDOWS HOST
==========================================================================
Set your VMware Player to use "NAT" in "Virtual Machine Settings" >> "Network 
Adapter". This is the default network configuration in VMware.

NAT is recommended in VMware when you don’t require to connect from an 
external machine in your LAN to your virtual machine. User programs like 
Firefox or ssh can operate through NAT.

NETWORK SETTINGS IN VMWWARE PLAYER / BRIDGED NETWORKING
HOWTO REACH OPENERP APPLIANCE ON A VMWARE PLAYER MACHINE FROM YOUR LAN
=======================================================================
Set your VMware Player to use "Bridged" in "Virtual Machine Settings" >> 
"Network Adapter"

NETWORK SETTINGS IN LINUX'S VIRT-MANAGER / NAT NETWORKING
HOWTO REACH OPENERP APPLIANCE ON A KERNEL VIRTUAL MACHINE (KVM) FROM LINUX HOST
===============================================================================
Set your virt-manager to use "NAT" in "Preferences". This is the default 
network configuration in KVM/virt-manager.
