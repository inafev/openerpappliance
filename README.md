- My Configuration Management source code used for building virtual machine appliances available at [OpenERP Appliance](http://openerpappliance.com). Those builds are now obsolete and the CM code is now public.
- OpenERP appliance is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). It's also an automation and Continuous Integration project for quality testing and demo purposes. OpenERP has been renamed as [Odoo Open Source ERP and CRM](http://www.odoo.com).
