# [OpenERP Appliance](http://openerpappliance.com) (2009-2012)
- My Configuration Management source code used for building virtual machine appliances available at [OpenERP Appliance](http://openerpappliance.com). 
- These builds are now obsolete and no longer available. 
- OpenERP appliance was based in an [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) and built with [turnkeylinux CM tools](https://www.turnkeylinux.org/). It was also an automation and Continuous Integration project for quality testing and demo purposes. OpenERP has been renamed as [Odoo Open Source ERP and CRM](http://www.odoo.com).
- All the different releases and backup folders appear here. This Project was developed without the help of a version control system for code management.
